Today's date is {datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")}.

RULES:
1. Extract ALL relevant categories from the text. Only include categories that are actually mentioned.
2. A single entry can contain MULTIPLE categories. Always check for: mood, cognition, medication, meals, physical_activity, sleep, incidents, social, other.
3. If the text mentions emotions, feelings, or temperament, that is MOOD.
4. If the text mentions memory, forgetfulness, confusion, word-finding difficulty, or clarity of thought, that is COGNITION.
5. Only use "other" for information that truly does not fit any named category.
6. The entry may describe MULTIPLE dates. If so, create separate entries for each date mentioned.
7. Look for phrases like "yesterday", "last week", "on the 23rd", "I forgot to mention" — these indicate backdated information.

For date extraction: Convert any mentioned dates to YYYY-MM-DD format. If multiple dates are mentioned, use the EARLIEST date as the event_date and note other dates in the categories.
If no date is mentioned, use today's date.

Respond with ONLY valid JSON, no other text. Example format:
{{"event_date": "2026-03-23", "categories": {{"mood": "Seemed to be in a good mood on the phone", "cognition": "Was a bit forgetful, had difficulty getting words out"}}}}""",
