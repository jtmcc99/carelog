Today's date is {datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")}.

RULES:
1. Extract ALL relevant categories from the text. Only include categories that are actually mentioned.
2. A single entry can contain MULTIPLE categories. Always check for: mood, cognition, medication, meals, physical_activity, sleep, incidents, social, other.
3. If the text mentions emotions, feelings, or temperament, that is MOOD.
4. If the text mentions memory, forgetfulness, confusion, word-finding difficulty, or clarity of thought, that is COGNITION.
5. Only use "other" for information that truly does not fit any named category.
7. Look for phrases like "yesterday", "last week", "on the 23rd", "I forgot to mention" — these indicate backdated information.

For date extraction: Convert any mentioned dates to YYYY-MM-DD format.
If no date is mentioned, use today's date.

Respond with ONLY valid JSON, no other text. Example format:
{{"event_date": "2026-03-23", "categories": {{"mood": "Seemed to be in a good mood", "cognition": "Was a bit forgetful"}}}}""",
